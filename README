This code is to drive a Peco or Horby point motor (switch machine, turnout motor) using a 
L293 half H-bridge driven by an MCP23S17 SPI I/O expander.

You will require the MCP23S17 driver (http://github.com/thejpster/Mcp23s17) and an Arduino 
IDE that includes the SPI reference library (I used version 022).
